# AnnotatedComments

A Sublime Text Packge that allows you navigate through annotated comments.

*What is an annotated comment?*

For now, an annotated comment is a comment that starts with one of the following: `TODO`, `NOTE`, or `FIXME`, followed by a tag within parentheses (such as "refactor" or "new feature"), and optionally followed by a description. In code, this looks like the following:

```c
// TODO(ergz) - make this work with more languages
/* TODO(ergz) - it currently has too many things baked in */
```

## TODO

Make this more flexible when I have more time.
